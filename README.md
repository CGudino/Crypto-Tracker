# Cryptocurrency price tracker

This is something I had quite a bit of fun (and a bit of frustration) building. Its purpose is quite simple. Just type in whatever cryptocurrency you want to check the price of and it will be added to the screen. The prices reload in real time so if there is a price change, you'll see it immediately.

This was created with create-react-app and doesn't use any external libraries except Sortable, which allows the individual trackers to be dragged and rearranged. Go ahead, try it!

The app comes with 7 currencies on the page by default, but you can delete and add as many as you want.

You can run a local instance of the app by cloning this repo, running npm install, then npm start. Or just click the link below. :)
